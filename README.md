## But whyyyyyyy

My rebooted emacs configuration.

For a while now, I've been using Doom, which has been great, but despite `evil` being nice and ergo-friendly, and doom having a really nice curated implementation of it, something _just isn't right_ about it.

So here I am, on my holiday break, making a new config for my emacs. Because that's who I am. I'm not proud. Or tired.

## But wherefore dot org?

Because Anatolii did it, and it was cool, so I did it. All of my stories start like that. I have no original thoughts at all.

Check out the full thing in so-called "literate" form, [notwithstanding dot org](https://github.com/j0ni/neumacs/blob/main/notwithstanding.org).

## Acknowledgements

I've borrowed liberally from others here, as well as from my own Doom customizations and my prior home-grown config. Particularly useful have been:

* Anatolii Smolianinov's ([zarkone](https://github.com/zarkone)) [freshly minted literate config](https://github.com/zarkone/literally.el). His recent cleanup and conversion from a many-files approach to the current version was a trigger for getting around to this.
* Oleh Krehel's ([abo-abo](https://github.com/abo-abo)) [illuminating config](https://github.com/abo-abo/oremacs). I use a bunch of his work, and though I haven't used his organizational patterns much, I learn a lot from how he structures stuff and might push a bit more in the direction of having separate `hooks.el` and `keys.el` files as this evolves. Mostly this seems to be a good solution to the fundamental `use-package` problem of dealing with intersectional fragments.

## Reuse verbiage

Copyright 2020 Jonathan Irving I guess? See the LICENSE.txt.

However, it's an emacs config, so do what you like with it! Unless you're an authoritarian, a fascist, or a principled capitalist aspiring 1-percenter, in which case fuck off!
